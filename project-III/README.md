# Computational Intelligence (CI)

## Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to resolve Travel Salesman Problem (TSP)

This is a project of the discipline Computational Intelligence (CI) at Federal University of Uberlandia (UFU - Universidade Ferderal de UberlÃ¢ndia). 

This project consists in implements an Ant Colony Optimization (ANC) to resolve Travel Salesman Problem (TSP). The full description of the requisits of this projects can be found at: docs/TrabalhoIntColetiva_2016_2.pdf.

To execute the code, you just have to type in terminal:

For example, if you want to execute the file ex1.py you can just type this command on terminal:
```bash
> python ex1.py
```

The report/report.pdf shows the experimental results.
