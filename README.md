# Computational Intelligence (CI)

This is a project of the discipline Computational Intelligence (CI) at Federal University of Uberlandia (UFU - Universidade Ferderal de Uberl√¢ndia). 

This project consists in implements an aritifical neural network (ANC) to recognize some digits: 0 to 5. The full description of the requisits of this projects can be found at: docs/Trabalho_Perceptron_2015_2.pdf.

The project consists in three steps:
- Create a perceptron ANC with one (1) neuron to recognize the digits 0 and 1.
- Create a perceptron ANC with two (2) neurons to recognize the digits 0 and 1.
- Create a perceptron ANC with six (6) neurons to recognize the digits: 0 to 5.

The implementation of each step can be found at:
- codes/ex1.py
- codes/ex2.py
- codes/ex3.py

For execute this files you can just type this commands:
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
