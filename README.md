# IC
inteligência computacional

This is a project of the discipline Computational Intelligence (IC) at Federal University of Uberlandia (UFU - Universidade Ferderal de Uberlândia). 

This project consists in implements an aritifical neural network (ANC) to recognize some digits: 0 to 5. The full description of the requisits of this projects can be found at: docs/Trabalho_Perceptron_2015_2.pdf.

The project consists in three steps:
1. Create a perceptron ANC with one (1) neuron to recognize the digits 0 and 1.
2. Create a perceptron ANC with two (2) neurons to recognize the digits 0 and 1.
3. Create a perceptron ANC with six (6) neurons to recognize the digits: 0 to 5.
